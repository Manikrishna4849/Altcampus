The construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya stands as a historic and symbolic milestone in the cultural and religious landscape of India. This sacred temple is dedicated to Lord Ram, a revered figure in Hinduism, and its inception marks the end of a long-standing legal and socio-political dispute over the site.
